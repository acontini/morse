A Demonstration of the Fine Art of Burning Network Bandwidth by
modulating Morse Code on Packet Length
------------------------------------------------------------------
For this to work, add a protocol called "morse" to /etc/protocols.
I used protocol 101 for this:

	morse	101	MORSE

Start 'morsercv' on the destination host and give the source host
name or IP address as its first argument. Then use 'morsesend' to
send a text line to the receiver.

Sequence numbering is implemented but no attempt at packet
reordering is done and limited-to-none recovery is performed.
